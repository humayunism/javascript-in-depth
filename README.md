# JavaScript Core Language Resources

Welcome to the **JavaScript Core Language** resource folder! This repository is a comprehensive guide to the core features of JavaScript, focusing on the language itselfâ€”its syntax, semantics, and built-in capabilities. Here, you'll find clear explanations and practical code examples to help you master JavaScript from the ground up.

## Whatâ€™s Inside

This folder is organized to help you learn and reference JavaScriptâ€™s core language features, including:

- **Variables & Data Types:** How to declare variables and work with JavaScriptâ€™s dynamic types.
- **Operators & Expressions:** Arithmetic, logical, comparison, and other operators.
- **Control Flow:** Conditional statements (`if`, `switch`), loops (`for`, `while`), and flow control.
- **Functions:** Function declarations, expressions, arrow functions, parameters, and closures.
- **Objects & Arrays:** Creating, accessing, and manipulating objects and arrays.
- **Scope & Hoisting:** Understanding variable scope, lexical environments, and hoisting behavior.
- **Prototypes & Inheritance:** The prototype chain, inheritance patterns, and ES6 classes.
- **Asynchronous JavaScript:** Callbacks, Promises, async/await, and the event loop.
- **Built-in Objects:** Working with `Date`, `Math`, `String`, `Array`, and more.
- **Error Handling:** Using `try/catch`, custom errors, and debugging basics.

Each topic includes concise explanations and real-world code samples to illustrate key concepts.
